HTTP History Exporter (Burp Suite Extension)

A simple Burp Suite extension built on the Montoya API that lets you:
	‚Ä¢	Export full HTTP history (requests + responses) for a single in-scope host.
	‚Ä¢	Choose between Burp XML or HAR 1.2 format.
	‚Ä¢	Filter by exact host (e.g. dev.manuf.app).
	‚Ä¢	Include or exclude responses.
	‚Ä¢	Save the results to a file for further automation or analysis.

‚∏ª

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	GUI Tab in Burp:
Provides a new HTTP Exporter tab with options to select host, format, and whether to include responses.
	‚Ä¢	Supported Formats:
	‚Ä¢	Burp XML (.xml) ‚Äî compatible with Burp‚Äôs native export schema.
	‚Ä¢	HAR 1.2 (.har, .json) ‚Äî for use in browsers, curl converters, or API replay tools.
	‚Ä¢	Scope Filtering:
Only exports requests matching the exact host you provide (e.g. dev.manuf.app).
	‚Ä¢	Portable JAR:
Packaged as a shaded JAR (includes Jackson), so no external dependencies are needed in Burp.
